					The best thing about this recipe is that you can make them and instead
					of cooking them on the spot, wrap them in the plastic wrap that comes
					with the empanada lids and freeze them (although making them with
					homemade empanada dough is always the best option). This recipe, is
					what is called a classic recipe, or some would say base. That is to
					say that this meat empanadas recipe is the most classic you will find,
					and if you find it hard to close them you can check the post where we
					discuss how to make empanadas repulgue.
