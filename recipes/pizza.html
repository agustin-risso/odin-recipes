					Making our own easy homemade pizza recipe is a much simpler process
					than we think, we just need to know the necessary pizza ingredients
					and the process to follow to integrate them.

					<h3>Ingredients</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>1 kilogram of strong flour</li>
						<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
						<li>2Â½ cups of warm water</li>
						<li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
						<li>30 grams of fresh yeast</li>
					</ul>

					Now, let's start the homemade pizza recipe! To do this, the first
					thing we are going to do is to mix in a bowl the warm water with the
					fresh yeast. To make a homemade pizza dough easily you can use this
					type of yeast or make a pizza dough with dry yeast, both are valid. If
					you prefer dry yeast, you must mix it with the flour and if, on the
					contrary, you prefer fresh yeast, it is essential to mix it with warm
					water. Fresh yeast is sold in bulk and must be kept in the
					refrigerator. In general, about 30 grams of fresh yeast is equivalent
					to about 10 grams of dry yeast, keep this in mind in case you want to
					use a different yeast than the one used in this Italian pizza recipe.
				</li>
				<li>
					When you have mixed the yeast with the water, add the two tablespoons
					of oil. Mix well to integrate all the ingredients for the pizza.
				</li>
				<li>
					Before the preparation cools, add in a large bowl the flour and salt,
					arrange them in the form of a volcano. Pour the previous mixture in
					the center.
				</li>
				<li>
					Now is when you have to start kneading well until you notice that the
					homemade pizza dough stops sticking to your hands and you can handle
					it without problems.
				</li>
				<li>
					When you have the fluffy pizza dough ready, you will have to shape it
					into a long tube and cut it into 4 partitions. Then, make a ball with
					each partition and cover them with a clean, dry cloth. Let them rest
					for 45 minutes. You will see that, little by little, they will begin
					to rise until they double in volume. Each ball of dough will serve to
					make a regular homemade pizza.
				</li>
				<li>
					After the corresponding time, sprinkle some flour on a table to
					prepare the homemade pizza, take one of the balls and place it on it.
					Now you will have to extend it with your hands stretching it from the
					center to the sides, giving it a circular shape. If you have a rolling
					pin you can also use it to make the dough thinner. Once stretched, you
					can add the homemade pizza sauce and the pizza toppings of your
					choice. You can use this delicious homemade tomato and onion pizza
					sauce recipe.
				</li>
				<li>
					Once you have chosen the ingredients and have your homemade pizza
					dough ready, you should preheat the oven at maximum temperature for
					about 20 minutes.
				</li>
				<li>
					After the time has elapsed, put the homemade pizza in the oven and
					bake it for approximately 10 minutes. You should keep an eye on it
					because the final time will vary depending on the type of oven and its
					intensity.
